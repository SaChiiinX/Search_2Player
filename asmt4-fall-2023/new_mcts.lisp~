;;  Monte Carlo Tree Search -- TEMPLATE!
;; ========================================

;;  Contracts for the following functions used by MCTS algorithm
;; ----------------------------------------------------------
;;     GET-ROOT-NODE
;;     NEW-MC-TREE
;;     INSERT-NEW-NODE
;;     SIM-TREE
;;     SIM-DEFAULT (defined for you) 
;;     BACKUP
;;     UCT-SEARCH
;;     SELECT-MOVE

;;  In addition, for testing, the COMPETE function is defined for you.


;;  Your MCTS functions may call the following DOMAIN-DEPENDENT
;;  functions that are defined in "othello-starter.lisp":
;; ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;     COPY-GAME               -- creates a copy of the given othello game board
;;     MAKE-HASH-KEY-FROM-GAME -- returns list of the form (WHITE-PCS BLACK-PCS WHOSE-TURN)
;;     WHOSE-TURN              -- returns *BLACK* or *WHITE*

;;  Your MCTS functions may call the following DOMAIN-DEPENDENT
;;  functions that are defined in "othello-the-rest.lisp":
;; ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
;;     DO-MOVE!        --  does a move (destructively modifies game struct)
;;     LEGAL-MOVES     --  returns VECTOR of legal moves
;;     GAME-OVER?      --  returns T or NIL
;;     DEFAULT-POLICY  --  returns random legal move

;;  Your MCTS functions should not need to call any of the MACROs defined
;;  in "othello-macros.lisp".


;;  Note:  If a player has no legal moves, but the game isn't over, then that
;;         player *must* pass...


;;  MC-NODE struct -- a node in the MCTS tree
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;  KEY:          a hash-table key (compact rep'n of current state of game)
;;  WHOSE-TURN:   *BLACK* or *WHITE*
;;  NUM-VISITS:   the number of times this state has been visited
;;  VECK-MOVES:   a VECTOR of the legal moves from this state
;;  VECK-VISITS:  a VECTOR recording the number of times each legal move
;;                   has been visited during MCTS
;;  VECK-SCORES:  a VECTOR recording the average scores for the legal
;;                   moves visited during MCTS
