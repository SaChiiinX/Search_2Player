**************** Description 

This version (1.0) is the first release of Sensory Graphplan.  In this
release, SGP supports:
  * Conditional effects using Factored Expansion.
  * Sensory actions and uncertainty.
  * Some simple heuristic optimizations (subgoal ordering, action
    ordering, ground operator instance precomputation).

This minor version (1.0g) is an update to version 1.0.  See the 
revision history section below for changes.

**************** Known Bugs and Workarounds


PDDL defines a fully recursive goal description form.  Currently, SGP
does not handle the full recursiion.  In particular, negation applies
only to atomic effects and to equality (that is, (not (P)) is
legitimate, but (not (exists (?x - square) (P ?x))) will not be
processed correctly).

The solution to this problem is to simply not have negated compound
forms in the input domains.
-----------------------
A few minor changes need to be made to make SGP runnable with Harlequin
LispWorks.  First, because the GP package is already defined in
Harlequin (as the nickname for the graphics-port package), SGP's GP
package must be renamed GRAPHPLAN.  Change the defpackage line in
loader.lisp and the in-package line in gp.lisp accordingly.  Second,
the filenames in the loader.lisp file must have the .lisp ending added
to them.
-----------------------
Sometimes inequality preconditions appear to not hold in SGP.  This 
anamoly is because the variables in the inequalities are not yet 
bound.  To fix this problem, either enable type the variables (by 
adding :typing or :adl to the domain :requirements), or make sure that 
the variables are bound before the inequality is evaluated.
