**************** Description 

This version (4.0) has minor bug fixes and some significant enhancements
for the planner - for example inclusion of the PDB planner
visualization/debugging tool.  UCPOP runs on most Lisp systems.  PDB
requires CLIM 2.0.

This minor revision (4.0.6) fixes many loading bugs and some geometry problems
of PDB.  A new implementation of ZLIFO is included,  for details please refer
